CS 14 - Assignment 2

The program starts by asking for the needed string consisting of the sign of the first number
followed by the number and than the operator followed by the second sign followed by the second number.
The program is expecting an input like "1234+1234" which will translate into Num1 sign postive, Num1 = 234, operator is +,
Num2 sign postive, Num2 = 234.
The program will create 3 Whopper objects, A,B,and C, and than it will do the proper operation. The program loops
so the user can run it as many times as wanted. All the operations are working and they are only limited in terms of memory
as we can only have an X amount of nodes in our vector.
