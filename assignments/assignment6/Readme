CS 14 - Assignment 6 Part 2

The program takes in a command line argument of ./a.out followed by a text file name like input.txt. The program then reads in the
information from the text file about the graph. The program is expecting the input file to have in int type, the number of vertexs followed
by the number of edges. The program then reads in the vertexs and sets the source and sink properly. The program then reads in the edges. 
The program has two classes, one for the vertexs and one for the edges. After reading the information in, the program will navigate through
the graph and record the path. Then the program will remove the unnecessary vertexs from the vector.The program then will output the flow
value along with the path of the graph in an output file that is generated from the name of the input file. The program will then run the 
algorithm again and will keep outputting the path and flow so long as the flow isn't zero. Each different flow path is outputted along with the 
corresponding flow, and then the program outputs the total flowrate after all the iterations. The program updates the flow after each iteration 
in the graph. After this,the program outputs the different path flowrates that make up the total flowrate. I tested with the only test case 
given, and the program works. Except for the number of vertexs and number of edges at the start of the input file, the program uses strings
so that vertexs can be called anything. I also implemented the priority queue used when navigating the graph. The first vertex in the input
file is considered the smallest while the last vertex entered is considered the biggest. 

NOTE**************** 
Make file runs the program as "./a.out input.txt"  so if testing with a different file name, the make file or the file
used for testing needs to be name changed appropriately.
