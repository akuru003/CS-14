CS 14 - Assignment 4

The program takes in a command line argument the input file name and will create 

NOTE********* 
Make file runs the program as "./a.out input1.txt"  so if testing with a different file name, the make file or the file
used for testing needs to be name changed appropriately. 

When downloading the .csv file, my computer is forcing it into an excel file, I dont think this matters as all you need
in the same directory is the Makefile, main.cpp, and the input1.txt as the .csv and .out file should be created when the 
program is run.
