CS 14 - Assignment 4

The program takes in a command line argument of an input file and will create a .out file with the same name.
The program uses the stl list to store the integers or fractions in the input file.The program puts them in a 
binary tree and uses the tree to properly sort the data. Once the data is sorted, the date is outputted to .out
file in the proper format. The fraction class has its own header and cpp file while the BinarySearchTree class is
written in the main cpp file. The BinarySearchTree class was created with templates, and has template specialization 
to deal with the Fraction class. I tested with many inputs and repetitions, and the ouput came out correctly. The 
submitted input and .out file contain the test cases given to use for testing with a few other tests. 

NOTE*********** 
Make file runs the program as "./a.out input1.txt" so if testing with a different file name, the make file or the file
used for testing needs to be name changed appropriately.
