CS 14 - Assignment 3

The program takes in a command line argument the input file name and will create two output files of .out and .csv.
The first two maxSum1 and maxSub2 algorithms should be working 100% correctly. Testing with the sample cases, the answers 
are all correct. The maxSum4 is almost fully working. From the test cases, it works for all of them except two. The last 
algorithm maxSum3, I was not able to fully get working. It works for a few cases,but it's not consistent at all. The program
will output in the .out file a 1 for valid or 0 for invalid sequence followed by the answer the algorithm found for each
algorithm. In the .csv file, the size of the vector is outputted followed by the minSeq, followed by the ansValid for all 
algorithms followed by the totalTicks for each algorithm. For the maxSum3, for the graphs in the report, since I was 
not able to get it close to fully functioning, I used the intial code given to see the totalTicks on just minSeq of 0 
and created a graph from that. 

NOTE********* 
Make file runs the program as "./a.out input1.txt"  so if testing with a different file name, the make file or the file
used for testing needs to be name changed appropriately. 

When downloading the .csv file, my computer is forcing it into an excel file, I dont think this matters as all you need
in the same directory is the Makefile, main.cpp, and the input1.txt as the .csv and .out file should be created when the 
program is run.
