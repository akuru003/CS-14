CS 14 - Assignment 1

The program starts by asking for the M number as well as two initial starting numbers
if the user wants. It also allows the user to remove only once or all pairs. 
The program will call the necessary functions needed to print the repeated sequence. 
The number of appearances of each number in the sequence will also be outputted. 
The program will then output a list of all possible pairs based on the m number 
and will start to remove each pair one by one until the list is empty if the user
asked to remove all pairs. The program will remove as many pairs 
using the initial conditions given by the user, and then it will pick a pair and
use that pair's numbers as the initial starting numbers and run a fibonaci 
sequence generating a subsquence and removing even more pairs. This process
is repeated until the list is all cleared. If the list size is too small that a 
fibonaci sequence cannot be detected, the program will return no fibonaci 
sequence. This should not be a problem as I made sure small M values had bigger
vector sizes so that a repeated sequence could be detected.The program loops 
allowing the user to rerun the program should they want to.

NOTE***
Any M value of M < 50 will be fine. Anything 50 - 100 will take a few seconds(20ish).
Any M value over 100 will take a few minutes to complete.
